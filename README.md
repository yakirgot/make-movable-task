# Make Movable Task

Run by installing dependencies with `yarn`, and then `npx live-server`

You are implementing makeMoveable(element) function, takes a dom element and make it movable by dragging with the mouse, markup and css are ready, only JS is needed

Implementation be clean and small (less than 40 lines of code)

Do not use the drag and drop API

Moving an elements should not affect page reflows

After dragging is over element should stay at the last position user has left it.

* Bonus: fork your solution, instead of leaving the element at last place revert back to original position with a nice animation
