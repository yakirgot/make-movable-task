    <p>
      You are implementing makeMoveable(element) function, takes a dom element
      and make it movable by dragging with the mouse, markup and css are ready,
      only JS is needed
    </p>

    <p>Implementation be clean and small (less than 40 lines of code)</p>

    <p>Do not use the drag and drop API</p>

    <p>Moving an elements should not affect page reflows</p>

    <p>
      After dragging is over element should stay at the last position user has
      left it.
    </p>

    <p>
      *Bonus: fork your solution, instead of leaving the element at last place
      revert back to original position with a nice animation
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Movable item 1</li>
      <li>Movable item 2</li>
      <li>Movable item 3</li>
      <li>Movable item 4</li>
    </ul>

    <p id="testbox">
